## 🔍 About the Kit

When AWS sneezes, the internet catches a cold.

Even small teams and local businesses depend on invisible systems — from email and payment apps to booking tools and cloud storage.  
When one fails, your customers still see *you*.

The Kit helps you stay calm and connected when things go wrong.

## 🧭 What’s Inside

Each section of the Kit lives on the webpage and can be explored interactively through expandable panels:

1. **Dependency Inventory** — Identify what your business relies on and how to respond when something breaks.  
2. **Graceful Degradation** — Keep customers informed and your business running when tech fails.  
3. **Incident Response (Simplified Playbook)** — A clear, calm plan for small teams to handle disruptions.  
4. **Business Resilience Meter** — A quick self-assessment to measure your readiness.  
5. **Communication Templates** — Ready-to-use messages for outages and recovery moments.
